# Project: 67 Years of LEGO


This project "EXPLORING 67 YEARS OF LEGO" is part of a course from DATACAMP.

In this project we work with a dataset on every single lego block that has ever been built! 

During this project we work concepts of Data manipulation, Data visualization and importing and cleaning data.
